## Basic Overview

<a href="https://github.com/aditya1962/BuyGrand/">BuyGrand </a>is a Java based shopping cart (desktop) application where registered users could buy products. The  uses <a href="https://www.java.com/">Java </a>as the UI render and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-2019">MSSQL </a> as the database model. The invoice generation process includes digital authentication which is performed using <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> (using a Convolutional Neural Network) with a web camera stream using <a href="https://opencv.org/">OpenCV</a>.
